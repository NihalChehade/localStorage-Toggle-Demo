      Mountain beavers are usually dark gray or brown, but their fur can range
      from slightly more reddish (rufa) to more blackish depending on
      subspecies, with a light patch under each ear. The animals have
      distinctively short tails. Adults weigh about 500–900&#160;g
      (18–32&#160;oz), with a few specimens topping 1,000&#160;g (35&#160;oz).
      Total length is about 30–50&#160;cm (12–20&#160;in), with a tail length of
      1–4&#160;cm (0.39–1.57&#160;in). Their superficial similarity with true
      beavers reflects only their relatively large size (for rodents), strong
      odor, preference for living in extremely watery / moist habitats, and
      propensity to gnaw bark and cut branches. Mountain beavers do not fell
      trees, build dams, live in lodges, or communicate by tail slappings (their
      tail is minute). They are predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular in above
      ground activities.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"

      They are known to climb trees a few meters to acquire food in the form of
      branches and leaves, but otherwise their diet consists mostly of ferns,
      especially species that are toxic to other animals.<sup

      Mountain beavers have an unusual projection on each
      <a href="/wiki/Molar_(tooth)" title="Molar (tooth)">molar</a> and
      <a href="/wiki/Premolar" title="Premolar">premolar</a> tooth, which is
      unique among mammals and allows for easy identification of teeth. This
      projection points toward the cheek on the upper tooth row, but points
      toward the tongue on the
      <a href="/wiki/Mandible" title="Mandible">lower</a>. The cheek teeth lack
      the complex folds of other rodents and instead consist of single basins.
      They are <a href="/wiki/Hypsodont" title="Hypsodont">hypsodont</a> and
      ever-growing. Two upper and one lower premolars are present, along with
      all the molars, giving a
